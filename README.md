## 🎯 Overview

The **TRIZ Ideation Engine** is a next-generation innovation platform that fuses the algorithmic rigor of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) with the generative power of Google's **Gemini 3 Pro AI**.

Unlike traditional brainstorming tools that merely record ideas, this platform **actively generates them** using proven methodologies:

| Framework | Purpose | Output |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **TRIZ** | Resolve technical contradictions | 40 inventive principles applied |
| **SCAMPER** | Iterative optimization | 7 creative triggers |
| **Six Thinking Hats** | Multi-perspective validation | Balanced evaluation |

---

## ⚡ Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TRIZ Principles | 40 |
| Thinking Hats | 6 |
| SCAMPER Triggers | 7 |
| Ideas Per Session | 200+ |
| Time to Validation | ~15 minutes |

## 🔄 The Double Diamond Process

![Double Diamond Process](infographics/png/TRIZ_02_Double_Diamond.png)

The engine implements a **7-phase Diamond Design** methodology with two cycles of divergence and convergence:

1. **Problem Definition** → Clear problem statement
2. **Deconstruction** → Problem components identified
3. **TRIZ Application** → 100+ raw ideas generated
4. **SCAMPER Iteration** → 200+ refined ideas
5. **Six Hats Analysis** → Multi-perspective evaluation
6. **Scoring & Ranking** → Top 10 solutions selected
7. **Action Plan** → Implementation roadmap

## 🛠️ TRIZ Methodology

![TRIZ 40 Principles](infographics/png/TRIZ_03_TRIZ_Principles.png)

**TRIZ** (Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadach) was developed by Genrich Altshuller after analyzing 200,000+ patents. Key insight: **Innovation follows predictable patterns**.

### Core Concepts
- **Technical Contradictions**: Improving one parameter worsens another
- **Physical Contradictions**: System must be in two states simultaneously
- **40 Inventive Principles**: Proven solutions to resolve contradictions

## 🎩 De Bono's Six Thinking Hats

![Six Thinking Hats](infographics/png/TRIZ_04_Six_Thinking_Hats.png)

Each hat is implemented as a **specialized AI agent**:

| Hat | Focus | Question |
|-----|-------|----------|
| ⚪ White | Facts & Data | "What information do we have?" |
| 🔴 Red | Emotions | "How do users feel about this?" |
| ⚫ Black | Risks | "What could go wrong?" |
| 🟡 Yellow | Benefits | "What are the advantages?" |
| 🟢 Green | Creativity | "What alternatives exist?" |
| 🔵 Blue | Process | "What's our next step?" |

## 🔧 SCAMPER Method

![SCAMPER Wheel](infographics/png/TRIZ_05_SCAMPER_Wheel.png)

Seven creative triggers for idea expansion:

- **S**ubstitute – Replace components
- **C**ombine – Merge with other elements
- **A**dapt – Alter for new use
- **M**odify – Change scale or attributes
- **P**ut to other use – Different purpose
- **E**liminate – Remove to simplify
- **R**everse – Turn inside out
